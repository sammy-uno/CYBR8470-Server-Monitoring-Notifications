# Server Monitoring Notifications

**Author:** Mustapha Friha

## Executive Summary
Most of the commercial enterprise server monitoring tools just send email notifications and/or open a server incident ticket to alert interested recipients when specific conditions are raised. Those tools are expensive and hard to customize to meet the specific needs of a company.

I am going to develop a simple and easy a real time server monitoring solution for this class project. I came up with this class project idea from a recent work experience.  There was no monitoring of the server's system resources like disk usage. The server was accessed manually everyday and its system resources checked. Automated alerts were needed to notify any issues about the health of the server. I will simply call the application: Server Monitoring Notifications. Because of the time constraints to deliver this project, the app will not be a fully fledged monitoring tool but it will lay the groundwork of a tool monitoring notifications system. 

One of the goal of the app is to have it available on different platforms. The app will be developed as an hybrid app which can be run on iOS and Android mobile devices and also and on the web. Having a single codebase for all platforms makes it much more easy to develop and maintain the app. I will be using Flutter SDK for the UI. The Flutter framework uses the Dart language. Both are open source frameworks developed by Google and they are one of the preferred hybrid development frameworks by mobile and web developers. Some of the features and qualities of Flutter are: rich library of widgets, high productivity, great performance, fast and simple development with hot reload capability to view instantly the changes.
