## Executive Summary
Hybride apps are developed using multi-platform web technologies. They are relatively easy to develop compare to native apps and they have a clear advantage by having a single code base for all platforms such as Android and iOS devices. There are few hybrid Mobile app frameworks available in the market. Each one has its pros and cons compare to the other one. The purpose of this project is to use a new a hybrid mobile framework called Flutter to develop a secure app. It is an open-source framework developed by Google. It is fairly new but it has already become one of the preferred development framework by mobile developers. Some of the features and qualities of Flutter are: rich library of widgets, high productivity, great performance since the Dart language used by Flutter UI compiles into native code (No JavaScript bridge), fast and simple development with hot reload capability to view instantly the changes.
